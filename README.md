# Banking-System

The Jolly Banker project is a C++ application designed to manage and process financial transactions, demonstrating the use of queues and binary search trees. It reads transaction data from a file, processes transactions using a queue to ensure FIFO order, and employs binary search trees for efficient account management and balance retrieval. This project showcases skills in class design and data structure implementation, providing a robust solution for handling various banking operations.
